This is a Ai concept oriented Evaluating Mathematical Idioms using Logic Programming

Algorithms are nothing but implementation of logic and control. Similarly, when the logic runs a mathematical function, we call it a mathematical expression. These expressions are the inputs we give to the program, based on which the program understands the rules that are present in the logic. Based on the understanding of these rules, future expressions can also be evaluated
